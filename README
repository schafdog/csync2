Fork of csync2 Notes
====================
This has been my fork of csync2, which until haven't been public. 
I have been using csync2 for many years to sync my cluster of tiny linux machines 
(geographical distributed), as well as between macs. 

While distributed / cluster file systems is of great interest;
I have tried both GlusterFS and Ceph; I prefer the loosly coupled 
of csync2, and I can live with manual fixing replication problem once in a while 

I did my first patches for csync2 in 2010, and suggested some ideas around
furture development without getting any feedback I decided to continue on my own.

Difference from LINBIT are many. Many code cleanups, but also new features: 

- Attempting to track FS operations correct to eliminate redundant operations, 
- Extended with a MOVE operation. Detect it locally and perform it on peers
- Supporting hardlinks (with bugs)
- Implement a Storage layer so it could be extended with NoSQL storages
- SQL Layer that implements SQL common between SQL "drivers"
- Much fewer global variables that prevented multiple instance of connections 
  and threading
- Added tests to ensure functionality when refactoring 
- tail file method on inotify generated file to do FS changes without scan
- Begining of a "sync" tool that would fix inconsistencies

Broken stuff
============ 
- Database format has change. Now stored un-encoded. Only url encoded over wire
- Wire protocol: Minimal but minor things has changed. Dont use with older versions
- Windows support via CYGWIN has not been maintained and is for sure broken.
- Database creating is not 100% correct.
- sqlite 2/3 has not been tested for a long time. Mostly mysql, and some PostgreSQL

Building on Mac:
================
Will most likely require some homebrew versions of tools:
- macOS bison with -W fails. Set YACC='<location of homebrew bison> -y' before ./autogen.sh


Future
======
- Implement inotity daemon

ORIGINAL README (from last public 2.0-rc2)

About csync2
============

Csync2 is a cluster synchronization tool. It can be used to keep files on
multiple hosts in a cluster in sync. Csync2 can handle complex setups with
much more than just 2 hosts, handle file deletions and can detect conflicts.

It is expedient for HA-clusters, HPC-clusters, COWs and server farms. If
you are looking for a tool to sync your laptop with your workstation, you
better have a look at Unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/)
too.

See http://oss.linbit.com/ for more information on csync2. The csync2
subversion tree can be found at http://svn.linbit.com/csync2/.

Documentation
=============

The latest version of the csync2 documentation can be found online at

	http://www.clifford.at/papers/2005/csync2/paper.pdf

and is mirrored at

	http://oss.linbit.com/csync2/paper.pdf

You should definitely read the documentation before trying to setup csync2.

The TeX source of the paper (as well as some slides for csync2 presentations)
can be found at <http://www.clifford.at/papers/2005/csync2/>.

The csync2 releases also have a copy of the 'paper.pdf' file bundled in the
csync2 source tarball.


More Documentation
==================

Eric Liang wrote a nice step-by-step introductions for using csync2 on redhat
machines:

Mailing List
============

There is a csync2 mailing list:

	http://lists.linbit.com/mailman/listinfo/csync2

It is recommended to subscribe to this list if you are using csync2 in
production environments.

Building csync2
===============

You'll need the GNU autotools and a compiler toolchain (gcc) for 
building csync2.

First, run the autogen.sh script:

karin$ ./autogen.sh

Then run configure, use ./configure --help for more options:

karin$ ./configure

Then run make:

karin$ make

csync2 should be built now. Direct any questions to the csync2 mailing list
(see above).
